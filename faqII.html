            <h4>Is drinking water a source of sodium?</h4>
            <p>
              Sodium is found in almost all foods (the main source of daily
              exposure) and in drinking water. Although sodium concentrations in
              drinking water are normally less than 20 mg / l, in some countries
              they can greatly exceed this amount. Some water softeners can
              significantly increase the sodium content of drinking water. If
              the concentrations exceed 200 mg / l, the water may have an
              unacceptable taste.

            <h4>Are there good and bad foods?</h4>
            <p>
              Surely you have heard or heard of good and bad food. But are there
              really good and bad foods? Nutrition specialists recommend taking
              the focus off food and emphasizing eating with a broader
              perspective, taking into account not only what food is consumed,
              but what else it is combined with, how it is cooked, how much salt
              or sugar is used. the aggregate, the portion size and the general
              health status of the person who consumes in their sociocultural
              environment.

            <h4>Is homemade food healthier?</h4>
            <p>
              Although the Dietary Guidelines for the Argentine Population
              recommend choosing foods prepared at home instead of processed, it
              is important to keep in mind that homemade food is not always
              healthier.

            <h4>Is lactose-reduced milk easier to digest?</h4>
            <p>
              Low or reduced lactose milk is easier to digest only for people
              with lactose intolerance. If people whose body produces the enzyme
              lactase normally consume milk low or reduced in lactose for a long
              time, the body of these people will stop producing lactase because
              it does not need it and consequently it could develop lactose
              intolerance.

            <h4>Do foods derived from GM crops cause cancer?</h4>
            <p>
              No. Cancer is a name applied to a spectrum of diseases in
              proliferating cells abnormally due to genetic and / or
              environmental factors, including tobacco smoke and UV rays from
              the sun, for example. There is no connection between GM crops and
              cancer, a burden of certain news that circulates.
